# Department-Specific Snapshot Updates

## Problem
Post-processors were averaging metrics across all departments and updating a single overall value in the snapshot sheets. This prevented department-specific performance tracking.

## Solution
Modified post-processors to update each department's snapshot sheet individually with department-specific metrics.

## Implementation Details

### Client Suspecting AI Post-Processor (âœ… FIXED)

#### Changes Made:
1. **Added department sheet mapping**:
   ```python
   self.department_sheets = {
       'doctors': '1STHimb0IJ077iuBtTOwsa-GD8jStjU3SiBW7yBWom-E',
       'delighters': '1PV0ZmobUYKHGZvHC7IfJ1t6HrJMTFi6YRbpISCouIfQ',
       'cc_sales': '1te1fbAXhURIUO0EzQ2Mrorv3a6GDtEVM_5np9TO775o',
       'cc_resolvers': '1QdmaTc5F2VUJ0Yu0kNF9d6ETnkMOlOgi18P7XlBSyHg',
       'filipina': '1E5wHZKSDXQZlHIb3sV4ZWqIxvboLduzUEU0eupK7tys',
       'african': '1__KlrVjcpR8RoYfTYMYZ_EgddUSXMhK3bJO0fTGwDig',
       'ethiopian': '1ENzdgiwUEtBSb5sHZJWs5aG8g2H62Low8doaDZf8s90',
       'mv_resolvers': '1XkVcHlkh8fEp7mmBD1Zkavdp2blBLwSABT1dE_sOf74',
       'mv_sales': '1agrl9hlBhemXkiojuWKbqiMHKUzxGgos4JSkXxw7NAk'
   }
   ```

2. **Modified update_snapshot_sheet method**:
   - Added `dept_key` parameter
   - Uses department-specific sheet ID
   - Updates individual department snapshot

3. **Changed processing logic**:
   - Removed overall percentage calculation
   - Updates each department snapshot individually
   - Reports successful department updates

#### Before:
```
ðŸ“Š Overall Client Suspecting AI Analysis:
   Total conversations: 750
   Total suspected AI: 13
   Overall percentage: 1.7%
ðŸ“Š Updating snapshot sheet with Client Suspecting AI: 1.7%
```

#### After:
```
ðŸ“ˆ Doctors: 2.2% (3/134)
ðŸ“Š Updating Doctors snapshot sheet with Client Suspecting AI: 2.2%
âœ… Successfully updated snapshot sheet with Client Suspecting AI: 2.2%

ðŸ“ˆ MV Resolvers: 1.6% (10/616)
ðŸ“Š Updating MV Resolvers snapshot sheet with Client Suspecting AI: 1.6%
âœ… Successfully updated snapshot sheet with Client Suspecting AI: 1.6%

âœ… Client Suspecting AI Analysis completed!
   Successfully updated 2 department snapshot(s)
```

## Other Post-Processors That Need Updates

### 1. Threatening Post-Processor
- Currently calculates average across departments
- Updates single snapshot sheet
- Needs similar department-specific update logic

### 2. Call Request Post-Processor
- Review if it averages or already does department-specific updates
- May need modification

### 3. Legal Alignment Post-Processor
- Review if it averages or already does department-specific updates
- May need modification

## Benefits
1. **Accurate Department Tracking**: Each department's performance is tracked individually
2. **No Data Loss**: Department-specific insights are preserved
3. **Better Decision Making**: Management can see which departments need attention
4. **Consistent Reporting**: All metrics are department-specific, not mixed averages

## Technical Notes
- Department sheet IDs are taken from `config/sheets.py`
- Department keys in filenames (e.g., `mv_resolvers`) must match the keys in `department_sheets` dictionary
- Each department must have the required metric column (e.g., "Clients Suspecting AI") in their snapshot sheet
- The system will skip departments without proper sheet configuration
